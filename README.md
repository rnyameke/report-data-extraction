The goal of snow_script.R is to determine the number of tickets per service, as well as obtain metrics around time spent on tickets.

The first step is importing the csv created by ServiceNow. See CodeBook.md for more information about this file.

The script summarizes the data after formatting the columns appropriately to produce the number of tickets resolved within specific time periods. It also provides mean, median and quartiles for resolution times.
